<h2>What are they?</h2>

<p>An output record is a kind of display list--a collection of
instructions for drawing something on the screen.

<p>
Some output records have children--a collection of inferior output
records.

<p>
<i>Displayed output records</i> correspond directly to displayed
information on the stream, and don't have children--they are leaf
nodes of the tree.  Displayed output records can be replayed.

<p>
Presentations are a special case of output records that remember the
object and type of object associated with the output.

<p>
<code>standard-tree-output-record</code> is a class provided by CLIM
to store longer sequences of output records.  It is optimized to store
output records that tend to be created one after another with
ascending y coordinates, such as you would find in a scrolling window
of text.  The insertion and retrieval complexity of this class is
roughly O(log n), but can break down to be O(n).

<pre><code>(define-application-frame test ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (display :application 
	    :output-record (make-instance 'standard-tree-output-record))
   (:layouts
    (:default display))))</code></pre>
