<br><a name="1"><h1>1 Overview of CLIM</h1></a>
<a name="LABEL=clim-overview"></a> The Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM) is a powerful Lisp-based programming
interface that provides a layered set of portable facilities for constructing
user interfaces.  These include basic windowing, input, output, and graphics
services; stream-oriented input and output extended with facilities such as
output recording, presentations, and context sensitive input; high level
``formatted output'' facilities; application building facilities; command
processing; and a compositional toolkit similar to those found in the X world
that supports look and feel independence.
<p>
CLIM provides an API (applications programmer interface) to user interface
facilities for the Lisp application programmer.  CLIM does not compete with the
window system or toolkits of the host machine (such as Motif or OpenLook), but
rather uses their services (to the extent that it makes sense) to integrate Lisp
applications into the host's window environment.  For example, CLIM ``windows''
are mapped onto one or more host windows, and input and output operations
performed on the CLIM window are ultimately carried out by the host window
system.  CLIM will support a large number of host environments including Genera,
Motif, OpenLook, the Macintosh, CLOE-386/486, and the Next machine.
<p>
The programmer using CLIM is insulated from most of the complexities of
portability, since the Lisp-based application need only deal with CLIM objects
and functions regardless of their operating platform (that is, the combination
of Lisp system, host computer, and host window environment).  CLIM abstracts out
many of the concepts common to all window environments.  The programmer is
encouraged to think in terms of these abstractions, rather than in the specific
capabilities of a particular host system.  For example, using CLIM, the
programmer can specify the appearance of output in high-level terms and those
high-level descriptions are turned into the appropriate appearance for the given
host.  Thus, the application has the same fundamental interface across multiple
environments, although the details will differ from system to system.
<p>
Another important goal in the design and organization of CLIM is to provide a
spectrum of user interface building options, all the way from detailed,
low-level specification of ``what goes where'', to high-level user interface
specification where the programmer leaves all of the details up to CLIM.  This
allows CLIM to balance the ease of use on one hand, and versatility on the
other.  By using high level facilities, a programmer can build portable user
interfaces quickly, whereas by recombining lower level facilities he can build
his own programming and user interfaces according to his specific needs or
requirements.  For example, CLIM supports the development of applications
independent of look and feel, as well as the portable development of toolkit
libraries that define and implement a particular look and feel.
<p>
In addition, CLIM's layered design allows application programs to exclude
facilities that they do not use, or reimplement or extend any part of the
substrate.  To these ends, CLIM is specified and implemented in a layered,
modular fashion based on protocols.  Each facility documented in this
specification has several layers of interface, and each facility is
independently specified and has a documented external interface.
<p>
The facilities provided by CLIM include:
<p>
<ul> [Geometry]  CLIM provides provides geometric objects like point,
rectangle, and transformations and functions for manipulating them.
<p>
[Graphics]  CLIM provides a rich set of drawing functions,
including ones for drawing complex geometric shapes, a wide variety of drawing
options (such as line thickness), a sophisticated inking model, and color.
CLIM provides full affine transforms, so that a drawing may be arbitrarily
translated, rotated, and scaled (to the extent that the underlying window
system supports the rendering of such objects).
<p>
[Windowing] CLIM provides a portable layer for implementing <a href="silica.html#CONCEPT=sheet"><i>sheet</i></a> classes (types of window-like objects) that are suited to support particular
high level facilities or interfaces.  The windowing module of CLIM defines a
uniform interface for creating and managing hierarchies of these objects
regardless of their sheet class.  This layer also provides event management.
<p>
[Output Recording]  CLIM provides a facility for capturing all output
done to a window.  This facility provides the support for arbitrarily scrollable
windows.  In addition, this facility serves as the root for a variety of
interesting high-level tools.
<p>
[Formatted Output] CLIM provides a set of macros and functions that enable
programs to produce neatly formatted tabular and graphical displays with very
little effort.
<p>
[Context Sensitive Input] The <a href="http://www.mikemac.com/mikemac/clim/presentation-types.htmlpresentation-types.htmlcommands.html#CONCEPT=presentation type"><i>presentation type</i></a> facility of CLIM
provides the ability to associate semantics with output, such that objects may
be retrieved later by selecting their displayed representation with the pointer.
This <a href="overview.html#CONCEPT=sensitivity"><i>sensitivity</i></a> comes along automatically and is integrated with the
Common Lisp type system.  A mechanism for type coercion is also included,
providing the basis for powerful user interfaces.
<p>
[Application Building] CLIM provides a set of tools for organizing an
application's top-level user interface and command processing loops centered on
objects called frames.  CLIM provides functionality for laying out frames under
arbitrary constraints, managing command menus and/or menu bars, and associating
user interface gestures with application commands.  Using these tools,
application writers can easily and quickly construct user interfaces that can
grow flexibly from prototype to delivery.
<p>
[Adaptive Toolkit] CLIM provides a uniform interface to the standard
compositional toolkits available in many environments.  CLIM defines abstract
panes that are analogous to the gadgets or widgets of a toolkit like Motif or
OpenLook.  CLIM fosters look and feel independence by specifying the interface
of these abstract panes in terms of their function and not in terms of the
details of their appearance or operation.  If an application uses these
interfaces, its user interface will adapt to use whatever toolkit is available
in the host environment.  By using this facility, application programmers can
easily construct applications that will automatically conform to a variety of
user interface standards.  In addition, a portable Lisp-based implementation of
the abstract panes is provided.
